This is a form used by professionals working with Sex Offenders. Someone brought it to my attention 
that instead of having to fill the form out and add all the numbers yourself, it would be great if 
there was a website where you could answer all of the questions, and the result was displayed to you. 

I found these questions online, and I am creating this website just to make filling out the questionnaire a
little easier.
